# Visualizing-JetBlue-Airlines-Operations

**Project Overview**

The primary objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the on-time performance of JetBlue Airways and compare it with Alaska Airlines using data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). By creating an interactive dashboard and story in Tableau, this project provides a comprehensive visual overview of key performance metrics, patterns, and comparisons. The final deliverable highlights JetBlue's on-time performance and its comparison with Alaska Airlines.

The goal is to provide actionable insights into JetBlue's and Alaska Airlines' performance, helping stakeholders make informed decisions based on visual data analysis.

**Key Components**

1)Data Procurement and Preparation:

-Collected 12 monthly datasets from the BTS website, covering January 2023 to December 2023.

-Utilized additional lookup tables from BTS for comprehensive data analysis.

-Staged and managed data using Python before importing it into Tableau.

2)Visualization Goals:

-Created visualizations that depict the on-time performance of JetBlue Airways.

-Focused on departure delays as the primary metric.

-Illustrated patterns or associations between different metrics that affect on-time performance.

-Identified and visualized Alaska Airlines as the closest competitor, comparing key performance metrics.

3)Tools and Techniques:

-Used Tableau for creating interactive dashboards and stories.

-Employed higher-order visual devices to clearly depict high-dimensional information.

-Incorporated time and geography dimensions in the visualizations to enhance the storytelling aspect.
